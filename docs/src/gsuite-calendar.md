# G Suite Calendar

Meetings are scheduled with G Suite Calendar for everything from Standups to
various other meetings. Here are some suggestions for calendars to add and
other configuration.

## Shared Calendars

The [Vacations and Holidays Calendar][0] is used for sharing out of office

put time off on this calendar.

The [Meetings Calendar][1] is used to share meetings that are open invite to
anyone at the company.

## Working Hours

Setting working hours in G Suite Calendar is recommended as it can help make
sure that people do not schedule meetings when you are out. This is especially
important since we have such a distributed workforce.

Google has [documentation][3] on all the features of working hours.
