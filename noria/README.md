Noria is a new streaming data-flow system designed to act as a fast
storage backend for read-heavy web applications based on [this
paper](https://jon.tsp.io/papers/osdi18-noria.pdf) from
[OSDI'18](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/gjengset).
It acts like a database, but precomputes and caches relational query
results so that reads are blazingly fast. Noria automatically keeps cached
results up-to-date as the underlying data, stored in persistent _base
tables_, change. Noria uses partially-stateful data-flow to reduce memory
overhead, and supports dynamic, runtime data-flow and query change.

Noria comes with [a MySQL
adapter](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria-mysql) that implements the
binary MySQL protocol. This lets any application that currently talks to
MySQL or MariaDB switch to Noria with minimal effort. For example,
running a [Lobsters-like workload](https://github.com/jonhoo/trawler)
that issues the [equivalent SQL
queries](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria/tree/master/applications/lobsters/src/endpoints/natural)
to the real [Lobsters website](https://lobste.rs), Noria improves
throughput supported by 5x:

![Noria speeds up Lobsters queries by 5x](https://people.csail.mit.edu/malte/projects/noria/lobsters-perf.svg)

At a high level, Noria takes a set of parameterized SQL queries (think
[prepared
statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement)), and
produces a [data-flow
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing) that maintains
[materialized views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view)
for the output of those queries. Reads now become fast lookups directly
into these materialized views, as if the value had been directly cached
in memcached. The views are then kept up-to-date incrementally through
the data-flow, which yields high write throughput.

## Running Noria

Like most databases, Noria follows a server-client model where many
clients connect to a (potentially distributed) server. The server in
this case is the `noria-server` binary, and must be started before
clients can connect. Noria also uses [Apache
ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) to announce the location of
its servers, so ZooKeeper must be running.

You (currently) need nightly Rust to build `noria-server`. This will be
arranged for
[automatically](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs#the-toolchain-file)
if you're using [`rustup.rs`](https://rustup.rs/). To build
`noria-server`, run

```console
$ cargo build --release --bin noria-server
```

You may need to install some dependencies for the above to work:

 - clang
 - libclang-dev
 - libssl-dev
 - liblz4-dev
 - build-essential

To start a long-running `noria-server` instance, ensure that ZooKeeper
is running, and then run:

```console
$ cargo r --release --bin noria-server -- --deployment myapp --no-reuse --address 172.16.0.19 --shards 0
```

`myapp` here is a _deployment_. Many `noria-server` instances can
operate in a single deployment at the same time, and will share the
workload between them. Workers in the same deployment automatically
elect a leader and discovery each other via
[ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/).

## Interacting with Noria

There are two primary ways to interact with Noria: through the [Rust
bindings](https://crates.io/crates/noria) or through the [MySQL
adapter](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria-mysql). They both
automatically locate the running worker through ZooKeeper (use `-z` if
ZooKeeper is not running on `localhost:2181`).

### Rust bindings

The [`noria` crate](https://crates.io/crates/noria) provides native Rust
bindings to interact with `noria-server`. See the [`noria`
documentation](https://jon.thesquareplanet.com/crates/noria/) for detailed
instructions on how to use the library. You can also take a look at the
[example Noria program](noria/examples/quickstart.rs) using Noria's
client API. You can also see a self-contained version that embeds
`noria-server` (and doesn't require ZooKeeper) in [this
example](server/examples/local-server.rs).

### MySQL adapter

We have built a [MySQL
adapter](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria-mysql) for Noria that accepts
standard MySQL queries and speaks the MySQL protocol to make it easy to
try Noria out for existing applications. Once the adapter is running
(see its `README`), you should be able to point your application at
`localhost:3306` to send queries to Noria. If your application crashes,
this is a bug, and we would appreciate it if you [open an
issue](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria/issues). You may also want to
try to disable automatic re-use (with `--no-reuse`) or sharding (with
`--shards 0`) in case those are misbehaving.

## CLI and Web UI

You can manually inspect the data stored in Noria using any MySQL client
(e.g., the `mysql` CLI), or use [Noria's own web
interface](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria-ui).

## Noria development

Noria is a large piece of software that spans many sub-crates and
external tools (see links in the text above). Each sub-crate is
responsible for a component of Noria's architecture, such as external
API (`noria`), mapping SQL to data-flow (`server/mir`), and
executing data-flow operators (`server/dataflow`). The code in
`server/src/` is the glue that ties these pieces together by
establishing materializations, scheduling data-flow work, orchestrating
Noria program changes, handling failovers, etc.

[`server/src/lib.rs`](server/src/lib.rs) has a pretty extensive comment at
the top of it that goes through how the Noria internals fit together at
an implementation level. While it occasionally lags behind, especially
following larger changes, it should serve to get you familiarized with
the basic building blocks relatively quickly.

The sub-crates each serve a distinct role:

 - [`noria/`](noria/): everything that an external program communicating
   with Noria needs. This includes types used in RPCs as
   arguments/return types, as well as code for discovering Noria workers
   through ZooKeeper, establishing a connection to Noria through
   ZooKeeper, and invoking the various RPC exposed by the Noria
   controller ([`src/controller/inner.rs`](src/controller/inner.rs)).
   The `noria` sub-crate also contains a number of internal
   data-structures that must be shared between the client and the
   server like [`DataType`](basics/src/data.rs) (Noria's "value"
   type). These are annotated with `#[doc(hidden)]`, and should be easy
   to spot in `noria/src/lib.rs`.
 - [`applications/`](applications/): a collection of various
   Noria benchmarks. The most frequently used one is `vote`, which runs
   the vote benchmark from ยง8.2 of the OSDI paper. You can run it in a
   bunch of different ways (`--help` should be useful), and with many
   different backends. The `localsoup` backend is the one that's easiest
   to get up and running with.
 - [`server/src/`](server/src/): the Noria server, including
   high-level components such as RPC handling, domain scheduling,
   connection management, and all the controller operations (listening
   for heartbeats, handling failed workers, etc.). It contains two
   notable sub-crates:

   - [`dataflow/`](server/dataflow/): the code that implements the
     internals of the data-flow graph. This includes implementations of
     the different operators ([`ops/`](server/dataflow/src/ops/)),
     "special" operators like leaf views and sharders
     ([`node/special/`](server/dataflow/src/node/special/)),
     implementations of view storage ([`state/`](server/dataflow/src/state/)),
     and the code that coordinates execution of control, data, and
     backfill messages within a thread domain
     ([`domain/`](server/dataflow/src/domain/)).
   - [`mir/`](server/mir/): the code that implements Noria's
     SQL-to-dataflow mapping. This includes resolving columns and keys,
     creating dataflow operators, and detecting reuse opportunities, and
     triggering migrations to make changes after new SQL queries have
     been added. @ms705 is the primary author of this particular
     subcrate, and it builds largely upon
     [`nom-sql`](https://docs.rs/nom-sql/).
   - [`common/`](server/common/): data-structures that are shared
     between the various `server` sub-crates.

To run the test suite, use:
```console
$ cargo test
```

Build and open the documentation with:
```console
$ cargo doc --open
```

Once `noria-server` is running, its API is available on port 6033 at the
specified listen address.

Alternatively, you can discover Noria's REST API listen address and port
through ZooKeeper via this command:

```console
$ cargo run --bin noria-zk -- \
    --show --deployment myapp
    | grep external | cut -d' ' -f4
```

A basic graphical UI runs at `http://IP:PORT/graph.html` and shows
the running data-flow graph. You can also deploy Noria's
[more advanced web UI](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria-ui) that serves
the REST API endpoints in a human-digestible form and includes the
graph visualization.
