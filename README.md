ReadySet is a transparent database cache for Postgres & MySQL that gives you the performance and scalability of an in-memory key-value store without requiring that you rewrite your app or manually handle cache invalidation. ReadySet sits between your application and database and turns even the most complex SQL reads into lightning-fast lookups. Unlike other caching solutions, it keeps cached query results in sync with your database automatically by utilizing your database‚Äôs replication stream. It is wire-compatible with Postgres and MySQL and can be used along with your current ORM or database client.
