ReadySet is a lightweight query cache that sits between your application and database and turns even the most complex SQL reads into lightning-fast lookups. 


Unlike other caching solutions, ReadySet keeps the cache in sync with your database automatically and requires no changes to your application code.

This means:

- No extra code to keep your cache and database in sync
- No extra code to evict stale records
- No TTLs to set - your cache is as up-to-date as your replication lag

ReadySet is based on the [Noria project from MIT](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/noria:osdi18.pdf).

### Quickstart
Curious to see how ReadySet works? Run through our [quick start](https://docs.readyset.io/quickstart) to kick the tires and cache queries in under five minutes. 

---
### Install with Docker
Getting up and running with ReadySet requires that you do three things: download ReadySet, connect it to a database, and create a cache.

#### 1. Download
The easiest way to install ReadySet is via Docker. First, download our Docker Compose file:

```
curl -L -o compose.yml "https://readyset.io/quickstart/compose.yml"
```

#### 2. Point to a database

Make sure your database is [configured to run with ReadySet](https://docs.readyset.io/deploy/configure-your-database) and then modify the downloaded Docker Compose file to include your database connection string:

```
name: readyset
services:
  cache:
    ...
    environment:
      # UPSTREAM_DB_URL: <your DB connection string>
  ...
  grafana:
    ...
    environment:
      # UPSTREAM_DB_URL: <your DB connection string>
```

#### 3. Run ReadySet
```
docker compose up -d
```

#### 4. Configure caching 

Once ReadySet is up and running, you'll need to [create caches](https://docs.readyset.io/cache/creating-a-cache) for the queries you want to speed up. Check out our [caching guide](https://docs.readyset.io/cache/profiling-queries) for more details.

## Project Status & Roadmap
ReadySet is currently in beta. Our team is hard at work stabilizing the system with a focus on PostgreSQL. Our MySQL support is considered alpha. You can learn more about how we're approaching this and follow along on our progress below. 

| Project | Progress | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| General System Testing | [Track](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/issues/434) | Run ReadySet in a production-like environment and validate its robustness in the presence of faults.| 
| Dataflow Testing | [Track](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/issues/431) | Expand testing of the ReadySet caching engine. |
| Benchmarking & Analysis  | [Track](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/issues/432) | Expand ReadySet's performance benchmarks to a wider array of workloads. | 
| Usability Improvements | [Track](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/issues/443) | Make it easier to configure, interact with, and debug ReadySet. | 
| High Availability | [Track](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/issues/433) | Ensure that ReadySet can accept connections, proxy queries, serve warm reads from the cache, and replicate writes from the primary database in the presence of certain failures. |
