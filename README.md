ReadySet is a lightweight query cache that sits between your application and database and turns even the most complex SQL reads into lightning-fast lookups.


Unlike other caching solutions, ReadySet keeps the cache in sync with your database automatically and requires no changes to your application code.

This means:

- No extra code to keep your cache and database in sync
- No extra code to evict stale records
- No TTLs to set - your cache is as up-to-date as your replication lag

ReadySet is wire-compatible with Postgres and MySQL.

### Install ReadySet
Getting up and running with ReadySet requires that you do three things: download ReadySet, connect it to a database, and create a cache. See our [Getting Started](https://docs.readyset.io/get-started) guide for more information.
