//! Implementations of various eviction strategies for the reader map.
//! All of the strategies are incorporated into a single enum, [`EvictionStrategy`],
//! using a single enum allows for a faster dispatch than using a dyn object,
//! for as long as the number of strategies is reasonable.
//!
//! The eviction has two components: the first one is the read component:
//! whenever a key is accessed the `on_read` method is called to update
//! the key metadata with a strategy specific method.
//!
//! The second component is `pick_keys_to_evict`, which is called whenever the
//! reader exceeds its memory quota. Once called the strategy will return an
//! iterator over the list of keys it proposes to evict.
//!
//! The eviction strategy is approximate LRU.
