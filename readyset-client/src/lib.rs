//! This create contains client bindings for [ReadySet](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset).
//!
//! # What is ReadySet?
//!
//! ReadySet is a new streaming data-flow system designed to act as a fast storage backend for
//! read-heavy web applications based on [this paper](https://jon.tsp.io/papers/osdi18-noria.pdf)
//! from [OSDI'18](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/gjengset). It acts like a
//! databases, but pre-computes and caches relational query results so that reads are blazingly
//! fast. ReadySet automatically keeps cached results up-to-date as the underlying data, stored in
//! persistent _base tables_ change. ReadySet uses partially-stateful data-flow to reduce memory
//! overhead, and supports dynamic, runtime data-flow and query change.
//!
//! # Infrastructure
//!
//! Like most databases, ReadySet follows a server-client model where many clients connect to a
//! (potentially distributed) server. The server in this case is the `readyset-server`
//! binary, and must be started before clients can connect. See `readyset-server --help` for details
//! and the [ReadySet repository README](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/) for details.
//! ReadySet uses [HasiCorp Consul](https://www.consul.io/) to announce the location of its
//! servers, so Consul must also be running.
//!
//! # Quickstart example
//!
//! If you just want to get up and running quickly, here's some code to dig into. Note that this
//! requires a nightly release of Rust to run for the time being.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use readyset_client::*;
//! # use readyset_client::consensus::{Authority, ConsulAuthority};
//! # use readyset_data::{DfValue, Dialect};
//! # use readyset_client::recipe::ChangeList;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let consul_auth =
//!         Authority::from(ConsulAuthority::new("127.0.0.1:8500/quickstart").unwrap());
//!     let mut db = ReadySetHandle::new(consul_auth).await;
//!
//!     // if this is the first time we interact with ReadySet, we must give it the schema
//!     db.extend_recipe(
//!         ChangeList::from_str(
//!             "CREATE TABLE Article (aid int, title varchar(255), url text, PRIMARY KEY(aid));
//!              CREATE TABLE Vote (aid int, uid int);",
//!             Dialect::DEFAULT_MYSQL,
//!         )
//!         .unwrap(),
//!     )
//!     .await
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//!     // we can then get handles that let us insert into the new tables
//!     let mut article = db.table("Article").await.unwrap();
//!     let mut vote = db.table("Vote").await.unwrap();
//!
//!     // let's make a new article
//!     let aid = 42;
//!     let title = "I love Soup";
//!     let url = "https://pdos.csail.mit.edu";
//!     article
//!         .insert(vec![
//!             aid.into(),
//!             title.try_into().unwrap(),
//!             url.try_into().unwrap(),
//!         ])
//!         .await
//!         .unwrap();
//!
//!     // and then vote for it
//!     vote.insert(vec![aid.into(), 1.into()]).await.unwrap();
//!
//!     // we can also declare views that we want want to query
//!     db.extend_recipe(
//!         ChangeList::from_str(
//!             "
//!         VoteCount: \
//!           SELECT Vote.aid, COUNT(uid) AS votes \
//!           FROM Vote GROUP BY Vote.aid;
//!         CREATE CACHE ArticleWithVoteCount FROM \
//!           SELECT Article.aid, title, url, VoteCount.votes AS votes \
//!           FROM Article LEFT JOIN VoteCount ON (Article.aid = VoteCount.aid) \
//!           WHERE Article.aid = ?;",
//!             Dialect::DEFAULT_MYSQL,
//!         )
//!         .unwrap(),
//!     )
//!     .await
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//!     // and then get handles that let us execute those queries to fetch their results
//!     let mut awvc = db
//!         .view("ArticleWithVoteCount")
//!         .await
//!         .unwrap()
//!         .into_reader_handle()
//!         .unwrap();
//!     // looking up article 42 should yield the article we inserted with a vote count of 1
//!     assert_eq!(
//!         awvc.lookup(&[aid.into()], true).await.unwrap().into_vec(),
//!         vec![vec![
//!             DfValue::from(aid),
//!             title.try_into().unwrap(),
//!             url.try_into().unwrap(),
//!             1.into()
//!         ]]
//!     );
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Client model
//!
//! ReadySet accepts a set of parameterized SQL queries (think [prepared
//! statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement)), and produces a [data-flow
//! program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing) that maintains [materialized
//! views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view) for the output of those queries. Reads
//! now become fast lookups directly into these materialized views, as if the value had been
//! directly read from a cache (like memcached). The views are automatically kept up-to-date by
//! ReadySet through the data-flow.
//!
//! Reads work quite differently in ReadySet compared to traditional relational databases. In
//! particular, a query, or _view_, must be _registered_ before it can be executed, much like SQL
//! prepared statements. Use [`ReadySetHandle::extend_recipe`] to register new base tables and
//! views. Once a view has been registered, you can get a handle that lets you execute the
//! corresponding query by passing the view's name to [`ReadySetHandle::view`]. The returned
//! [`View`] can be used to query the view with different values for its declared parameters
//! (values in place of `?` in the query) through [`View::lookup`] and [`View::multi_lookup`].
//!
//! Writes are fairly similar to those in relational databases. To add a new table, you extend the
//! recipe (using [`ReadySetHandle::extend_recipe`]) with a `CREATE TABLE` statement, and then
//! use [`ReadySetHandle::table`] to get a handle to the new base table. Base tables support
//! similar operations as SQL tables, such as [`Table::insert`], [`Table::update`],
//! [`Table::delete`], and also more esoteric operations like [`Table::insert_or_update`].
//!
//! # Alternatives
//!
//! ReadySet provides an
//! [adapter](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/tree/main/readyset) that implements the
//! binary MySQL and PostgreSQL protocols, which provides a compatibility layer for applications
//! that wish to continue to issue ad-hoc MySQL or PostgreSQL queries through existing SQL client
//! libraries.

/// Maximum number of requests that may be in-flight _to_ the connection pool at a time.
///
/// We want this to be > 1 so that multiple threads can enqueue requests at the same time without

/// The value isn't higher, because it would unnecessarily consume memory.
///
/// The value isn't lower, because it would mean fewer concurrent enqueues.
///
/// NOTE: This value also places a soft-ish limit on the number of instances you can have of
/// `View`s or `Table`s that include a particular endpoint address when sharding is enabled. The
/// reason for this is kind of subtle: when you `poll_ready` a `View` or `Table`, we internally
/// `poll_ready` all the shards of that `View` or `Table`, each of which is a `tower-buffer`. When
/// you `poll_ready` a `tower-buffer`, it reserves a "slot" in its buffer for the coming request,
/// effectively reducing the capacity of the channel by 1 until the send happens. But, with
/// sharding, it may be that no request then goes to a particular shard. So, you may end up with
/// *all* the slots to a given resource taken up by `poll_ready`s that haven't been used yet. A
/// similar issue arises if you ever do:
///
/// ```ignore
/// view.ready().await;
/// let req = reqs.next().await;
/// view.call(req).await;
/// ```
///
/// When `ready` resolves, it will be holding up a slot in the buffer to `view`. It will continue
/// to hold that up all the way until the next request arrives from `reqs`, which may be a very
/// long time!

/// This problem is also described inhttps://github.com/tower-rs/tower/pull/425 and
/// https://github.com/tower-rs/tower/issues/408#issuecomment-593678194. Ultimately, we need
