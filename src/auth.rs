// git authentication logic borrowed from `cargo` crate

/// Prepare the authentication callbacks for cloning a git repository.
///
/// The main purpose of this function is to construct the "authentication
/// callback" which is used to clone a repository. This callback will attempt to
/// find the right authentication on the system (without user input) and will
/// guide libgit2 in doing so.
///
/// The callback is provided `allowed` types of credentials, and we try to do as
/// much as possible based on that:
///
/// * Prioritize SSH keys from the local ssh agent as they're likely the most
///   reliable. The username here is prioritized from the credential
///   callback, then from whatever is configured in git itself, and finally
///   we fall back to the generic user of `git`.
///
/// * If a username/password is allowed, then we fallback to git2-rs's
///   implementation of the credential helper. This is what is configured
///   with `credential.helper` in git, and is the interface for the OSX
///   keychain, for example.
///
/// * After the above two have failed, we just kinda grapple attempting to
///   return *something*.
///
/// If any form of authentication fails, libgit2 will repeatedly ask us for
/// credentials until we give it a reason to not do so. To ensure we don't
/// just sit here looping forever we keep track of authentications we've
/// attempted and we don't try the same ones again.
